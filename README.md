Campus Network Design & Implementation

The aim of this project is to design the topology of the university network using the software Cisco Packet Tracer and implementation with proper hardware equipment.


## Project Statement
In this mini-project, I have designed a simulation of a campus network based on wireless networking, which is divided into three distinct areas: one for the students and the other two for the teachers and academic staff. 

The primary objective of this project is to illustrate the significance of wireless connectivity in university settings, emphasizing mobility as a central focus. To ensure equitable access and functionality for all users, including students, teachers, and various university staff members, we have incorporated DNS, Email, and HTTP servers to maximize resource utilization. Additionally, we have implemented protocols such as BGP and OSPF to enhance network security.

<b> Technologies Implemented</b>

-  Creating a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
-  Hierarchical Network Design.
-  Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
-  Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers.
-  Subnetting and IP Addressing.
-  Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick).
-  Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server).
-  Configuring SSH for secure Remote access.
-  Configuring RIPv2 as the routing protocol.
-  Configuring switchport security or Port-Security on the switches.
-  Host Device Configurations.
-  Test and Verifying Network Communication.

<b> Network Topology Created</b>

The network topology below satisfy the user requirements above and everything is verified, tested and working fine.
